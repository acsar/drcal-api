# 📚 Git Branching & Development Guide

This document defines the **official way to work with Git in this project**, including the correct use of branches, commits, and pushes to GitHub.

> 💡 This guide is intended for both beginners and experienced developers, with practical examples and ready-to-use commands.

---

## 📌 Purpose

Keep the project **organized**, with the `main` branch **always stable**, avoiding conflicts and rework during development.

---

## ✅ General Rules

1. **NEVER develop directly on the `main` branch.**
2. **Create a new branch** for each new feature, bug fix, or technical task.
3. **Give clear names** to branches.
4. Always **open a Pull Request** on GitHub when you finish a task.
5. After merging, **delete the branch** that was used.
